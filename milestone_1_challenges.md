## Instructions

- Create a file called `milestone_1_challenges.js`
- Write the solution to each challenge in that file.
- Separate each challenge’s code clearly with comments that include the challenge title or number. For example:

```js
// Challenge 1: Sum of two numbers
// Your solution here

// Challenge 2: BMI Calculator
// Your solution here
```

- Make sure your code is neatly formatted and easy to read. Use prettier to format your code - `prettier --write filename.js`
- Name your functions exactly as described in each challenge, if a challenge has not provided a function name, come up with a suitable name.
- Always run your code to ensure it works as expected.
- Once you're done, push your work to GitHub and share the link to the repo with me for a review.

### Pro Tips

- Commit often with clear messages (e.g., "Completed Challenge 3: Sum of Even Numbers").
- Comment your logic briefly if you want, but don’t overdo it.

## 1. Return the Sum of Two Numbers

Create a function called `addition` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

```js
addition(3, 5); // 8
addition(-6, 9); // 3
```

## 2. Convert Minutes into Seconds

Write a function called `convert` that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.

```js
convert(5); // 300
convert(2); // 120
```

## 3. Perimeter of a Rectangle

Create a function that takes length and width and finds the perimeter of a rectangle.

```js
findPerimeter(6, 7); // 26
findPerimeter(20, 10); // 60
```

## 4. Check Negative

Write a function called `isNegative` that takes a number as it's only argument, the function should return true if the passed number is a negative number and false if the passed number is not a negative number.

```js
isNegative(-23); // true
isNegative(55); // false
```

## 5. Can I Drive

Write a function that takes in a person's name and age. If they're 18 or older, return a message like 'Alice is old enough to drive.' If they're younger, return 'Bob is not old enough to drive yet.'

```js
canDrive("Jane", 22); // Jane is old enough to drive
canDrive("June", 12); // June is not old enough to drive yet
```

## 6. Largest Number

Write a function called `findLargest(a, b, c)` that takes three numbers and returns the largest of the three

```js
findLargest(5, 9, 3); // 9
findLargest(10, 10, 10); // 10
findLargest(-1, -5, -3); // -1
```

## 7. BMI Calculator

Write a function called calculateBMI(weight, height) that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the following formula:

> `BMI = weight / (height * height)`

Where:

`weight` is in kilograms (kg)

`height` is in meters (m)

The function should return a string that includes the BMI and the corresponding BMI category based on the value:
| BMI Range | Category |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Less than 18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5 – 24.9 | Normal weight |
| 25 – 29.9 | Overweight |
| 30 or more | Obese |

```js
calculateBMI(68, 1.75); //Your BMI is 22.2 - Normal weight
calculateBMI(85, 1.8); // Your BMI is 26.2 - Overweight
```

## 8. Greeting Based On Time

Write a function called `greetUser(name, hour)` that returns a personalized greeting based on the hour of the day.

- The `name` is a string representing the user's name.
- The `hour` is a number from 0 to 23, representing the current hour in 24-hour format.

Return a greeting like:

- `"Good morning, Alice!"` if the hour is between 5 and 11
- `"Good afternoon, Alice!"` if the hour is between 12 and 17
- `"Good evening, Alice!"` if the hour is between 18 and 21
- `"Good night, Alice!"` if the hour is 22–4

## 9. FizzBuzz

Write a function called fizzBuzzCheck(number) that takes a number and returns:

- `"Fizz"` if the number is divisible by 3
- `"Buzz"` if the number is divisible by 5
- `"FizzBuzz"` if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5
- If it’s divisible by neither, return the number itself as a string

```js
fizzBuzzCheck(3); // "Fizz"

fizzBuzzCheck(10); // "Buzz"

fizzBuzzCheck(15); // "FizzBuzz"

fizzBuzzCheck(7); // "7"
```

## 10. Perimeter 2

Write a function that takes a number and returns the perimeter of either a circle or a square. The input will be in the form (letter l, number num) where the letter will be either "s" for square, or "c" for circle, and the number will be the side of the square or the radius of the circle.

Use the following formulas:

> Perimeter of a square: 4 _ side.
> Perimeter of a circle: 6.28 _ radius.

```js
perimeter("s", 7); //28
perimeter("c", 4); //25.12
```

## 11. Sum of Even Numbers

Write a function called `sumEvenNumbers(n)` that takes a number `n` and returns the sum of all even numbers from 1 up to and including `n`.

```js
sumEvenNumbers(6); // 12  (2 + 4 + 6)
sumEvenNumbers(10); // 30  (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
sumEvenNumbers(5); // 6   (2 + 4)
```

## 12. Multiply by Itself

Write a function called `powerUp(num, times)` that takes two numbers and returns the result of multiplying `num` by itself `times` times using only a loop and arithmetic operators (no `Math.pow()` allowed).

```js
powerUp(2, 3); // 8  (2 * 2 * 2)
powerUp(5, 0); // 1  (anything to the zero power is 1)
powerUp(3, 4); // 81 (3 * 3 * 3 * 3)
powerUp(0); // 1
```

## 13. Factorial Calculator

Write a function called `factorial(n)` that takes a non-negative integer n and returns the factorial of `n` — that’s the product of all positive integers from 1 up to n.
By definition, factorial of 0 is 1.

```js
factorial(0); // 1
factorial(4); // 24  (1 * 2 * 3 * 4)
factorial(6); // 720 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6)
```

## 14. Multiple Sum

Write a function called `sumMultiples(n, divisor)` that returns the sum of all numbers from 1 up to `n` that are divisible by `divisor`.

```js
sumMultiples(10, 2); // 30  (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
sumMultiples(15, 3); // 45  (3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15)
sumMultiples(7, 5); // 5
```

## 15. Sum of Digits

Write a function called `sumDigits(num)` that takes a positive integer and returns the sum of its digits.

Constraints:

- You cannot convert the number to a string or use arrays.
- Use arithmetic operators and loops only.

```js
sumDigits(123);   // 6   (1 + 2 + 3)
sumDigits(4567);  // 22  (4 + 5 + 6 + 7)
sumDigits(0);     // 0

**Hint:**
- Use % (modulo) to get the last digit.
- Use integer division (like `Math.floor(num / 10)`) to chop off the last digit.
- Repeat until the number becomes 0.
